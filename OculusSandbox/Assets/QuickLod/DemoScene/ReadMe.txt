### Scene notes ###

MainDemoScene:
To change the amount of objects, select the "Object Placement" object and set new values on the "Test Placement" component. 
Apply them with the component menu option "Update placement".

GroupSwitchDemo:
Not a lot to do, the GroupSwitch object contains the group switch.
Also it contains all triggers as children.
